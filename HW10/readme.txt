This homework applies several different DSP methods. From the video we can see that MAF and FIR are the best in this particular application (of basically acting as a low pass filter). Since MAF and FIR both work particularly well at smoothing out the data, I would say that MAF is the better choice for this application since it is considerably easier to implement in code, requires fewer mathematical operations, and takes up less memory
