Mario Sebasco - Advanced Mechatronics HW

This HW uses SPI to connect to an LCD screen. The screen displays "Hello World!" followed by a number, and a progress bar which is the length in pixels of the number. The data is being displayed at 5Hz (i.e. 5FPS)

 - In reference to the questions asked for the HW
  -   Each letter is 5x8, and the screen is 128x128, so a total of 400 letters can be displayed.
